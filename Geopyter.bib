@article{Brunsdon:2020aa,
	abstract = {This paper reflects on a number of trends towards a more open and reproducible approach to geographic and spatial data science over recent years. In particular, it considers trends towards Big Data, and the impacts this is having on spatial data analysis and modelling. It identifies a turn in academia towards coding as a core analytic tool, and away from proprietary software tools offering `black boxes'where the internal workings of the analysis are not revealed. It is argued that this closed form software is problematic and considers a number of ways in which issues identified in spatial data analysis (such as the MAUP) could be overlooked when working with closed tools, leading to problems of interpretation and possibly inappropriate actions and policies based on these. In addition, this paper considers the role that reproducible and open spatial science may play in such an approach, taking into account the issues raised. It highlights the dangers of failing to account for the geographical properties of data, now that all data are spatial (they are collected somewhere), the problems of a desire for {\$}{\$}n{\$}{\$}n = all observations in data science and it identifies the need for a critical approach. This is one in which openness, transparency, sharing and reproducibility provide a mantra for defensible and robust spatial data science.},

	abstract = {Twenty years have passed since Bivand and Gebhardt (J Geogr Syst 2(3):307--317, 2000. https://doi.org/10.1007/PL00011460) indicated that there was a good match between the then nascent open-source R programming language and environment and the needs of researchers analysing spatial data. Recalling the development of classes for spatial data presented in book form in Bivand et al. (Applied spatial data analysis with R. Springer, New York, 2008, Applied spatial data analysis with R, 2nd edn. Springer, New York, 2013), it is important to present the progress now occurring in representation of spatial data, and possible consequences for spatial data handling and the statistical analysis of spatial data. Beyond this, it is imperative to discuss the relationships between R-spatial software and the larger open-source geospatial software community on whose work R packages crucially depend.},

@article{Solis:2020aa,
	abstract = {OpenStreetMap (OSM), often thought of as a technological tool or platform, can be envisioned as a community of communities and informed by a broad understanding of geographical systems. In this article, we explore the community of university students known as YouthMappers, who utilize OSM and related tools for humanitarian data creation, analysis and learning. Students approach OSM simultaneously as aspiring members of the workforce in a global digital economy and as emerging world citizens of a global society. Established in 2014, YouthMappers is a campus-based consortium of more than 200 chapters in approximately 50 countries that networks and supports engagement in humanitarian data with practitioners, government agencies, and other actors. Open geospatial data are contributed to authentic campaigns through OpenStreetMap and an ecosystem of open source and proprietary tools. A 2019 survey of YouthMappers and an analysis of YouthMappers data contributions allow us to explore the following questions: Who are using open geospatial tools, and in what context? Which open geospatial tools are being used and where? How proficient are they as users? How confident do they feel? How prepared does this make them for the future? How do these patterns vary across the global digital divide? Results show evidence of mapping both locally and globally. They also reveal a gendered confidence gap, and tool use patterns hint at a gendered division of geospatial labor in some global contexts. Internships are key to unlocking job opportunities, and are prevalent among YouthMappers members. Findings also reveal that with growing self-reported proficiency, a commitment to the ethic of being a good global citizen increases, underscoring the potential promise for open geospatial tools to support not only workforce capacity, but also meaningful connections to learning about geography, place, people, and the world.},

	abstract = {Abstract The movement toward open education is requiring educators to expand and update their practice in order to keep up with the new demands being placed on them. This study explored how educators can engage in meaningful learning opportunities, which will facilitate the creation of expertise and knowledge, through the use of open education resources (OER). The article describes the design of the instrument employed to measure workplace learning through OER activity of adult educators (n = 522) and to report its internal reliability and convergent validity. Results indicate engagement with OER promote three levels of learning, each connected to the different types of knowledge educators require to integrate OER into their teaching practice.},

@article{ArribasBel2018,
	abstract = {Abstract The discipline of Geography has long been intertwined with the use of computers. This close interaction is likely to increase with the embeddedness of computers and concomitant growth of spatially referenced data. To better understand the current situation, and to be able to better speculate about the future, this article provides two parallel perspectives: first, we offer an historical perspective on the relationship between Geography and computers; second, we document developments---in particular the nascent field of data science---that are currently taking place outside of Geography and to which we argue the discipline should be paying close attention. Combining both perspectives, we identify the benefits of tighter integration between Geography and Data Science and argue for the establishment of a new space---that we term Geographic Data Science---in which cross-pollination could occur to the benefit of both Geography and the larger data community.},
